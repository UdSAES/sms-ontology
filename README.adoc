Making models, the ability to simulate them, and the simulation results part of the Semantic Web requires an ontology that links the real (or envisioned) world in terms of systems, context, initial state, ... to their abstract representations as model instances, input data, initial conditions et cetera and also captures knowledge about the involved concepts. The ontology developed in this repository does just that.

IMPORTANT: *Recent improvements to code and README/documentation have not been pushed to GitHub yet -- will be fixed as soon as possible*, certainly in calender week 7! (2022-02-13)
